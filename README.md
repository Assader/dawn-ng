# dawn-ng
This is a fork of DAWN(https://github.com/berlin-open-wireless-lab/DAWN) Decentralized WiFi Controller. The code is refactored, some bugs are fixed, custom features added...
The controller provides 802.11 k/v features over OpenWRT.

## Installation

**You need full wpad installation and not wpad-basic**.

See [installation](INSTALL.md).

## Configuration

## ubus interface
To get an overview of all connected Clients sorted by the SSID.

    root@OpenWrt:~# ubus call dawn get_network
    {
	    "Free-Cookies": {
		    "00:27:19:XX:XX:XX": {
			    "78:02:F8:XX:XX:XX": {
				    "freq": 2452,
				    "ht": 1,
				    "vht": 0,
				    "collision_count": 4
			    }
		    },
		    "A4:2B:B0:XX:XX:XX": {
			    "48:27:EA:XX:XX:XX: {
				    "freq": 2412,
				    "ht": 1,
				    "vht": 0,
				    "collision_count": 4
			    },
		    }
	    },
	    "Free-Cookies_5G": {

	    }
    }
To get the hearing map you can use:

    root@OpenWrt:~# ubus call dawn get_hearing_map
    {
	    "Free-Cookies": {
		    "0E:5B:DB:XX:XX:XX": {
			    "00:27:19:XX:XX:XX": {
				    "signal": -64,
				    "freq": 2452,
				    "ht_support": true,
				    "vht_support": false,
				    "channel_utilization": 12,
				    "num_sta": 1,
				    "ht": 1,
				    "vht": 0,
				    "score": 10
			    },
			    "A4:2B:B0:XX:XX:XX": {
				    "signal": -70,
				    "freq": 2412,
				    "ht_support": true,
				    "vht_support": false,
				    "channel_utilization": 71,
				    "num_sta": 3,
				    "ht": 1,
				    "vht": 0,
